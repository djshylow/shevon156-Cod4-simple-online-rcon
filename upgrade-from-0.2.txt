Upgrade instructions:

Before you start upgrading:
this package requires PHP WebRcon 0.2 alpha (with with #1 and #2 patches) installed;
if you have installed Custom Rotation plugin manually, the upgrade will delete your custom playlist - you will have to create it via web interface after the upgrade;

Upgrade instructions:
- you may want to disable all the cron plugins for the time of upgrade (edit your cron/ini/config.ini and set all enabled to 0)
- unpack locally or remotely in a temporary folder;
- from this temporary folder remove files/folders:
	application/config/
	cron/ini/
- copy files from temp directory over you installation, overwriting all existing;
- point you browser to http://yourserver.com/install/upgrade.php;
- follow instructions and press Next;

To start using Custom playlists you will have to add the corresponding permission to your users:
- point your browser to http://yourserver.com/index.php/servers/permissions;
- press Delete and then assign new permissions for the appropriate users (note new permission Can set playlists)

Then you can return to dashboard, choose current server and then go to Playlists to create your custom playlist.

To actually activate Custom Rotation cron plugin add the following text into your cron/ini/config.ini:
; ------------------------------
; Custom rotation
; ------------------------------
[customRotation]
enabled = 1;

Notes:
1. Now you can combine your custom playlist only from atomic default playlists, i.e you cannot add Team Tactical playlist - but you can imitate it by adding all the playlists that are in it manually.
2. Custom playlists have status Active: you can have only one (or none) active custom playlist per server. Turn them On/Off on the Playlists page.
3. You can use this Custom playlist even with one gametype included: it will simply "rotate" the same gametype over and over.
4. Don't forget to Turn Off the active Custom playlist if you intend to start using other RCONs for playlist management, otherwise next minute Custom Rotation plugin would take over rotation.
